      <p class="service-page-content">At Signalayer we are committed to maintaining the confidentiality and security of any personal information about our Customers, their employees and users. Privacy protection is always at the top of our priorities, and we are focused on protecting it from unauthorized access. This Privacy Policy supplements our Service Agreement and spells out how we collect, use, and disclose information from or about you through our products and services.
        <br><br> Users can access our services (the “Service”) via our website www.signalayer.com, customer domains, applications on Devices, APIs, and third-parties. A “Device” is any device used to access the Signalayer Service, including without limitation a computer, mobile phone, tablet, or other electronic device. By using our Service you are consenting to the collection, transfer, processing, storage, disclosure and other uses described in this Privacy Policy. The use of information collected through our services  shall be limited to the purpose of providing the service for which our customers (“Customer”) have engaged Signalayer.</p>

          <p class="privacy-page-text"><span class="privacy-text-subtitle">Information you provide</span><br><br>When your account is created, we securely collect some personal information, such as your name, email address, phone number, credit card or other billing information.</p>
          <p class="privacy-page-text"><span class="privacy-text-subtitle">Log data</span><br><br>When you use our Service, we automatically collect certain information from your Device, its software, and your activity using the Services. This may include, for example (but without limitation), the Device&#x27;s Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, the web page visited before you came to our website, domains where you use our services, information you search for on our website and inside our products, locale preferences, identification numbers associated with your Devices, date and time stamps associated with transactions, system configuration information, metadata, and interactions with the Services and products.</p>
          <p class="privacy-page-text"><span class="privacy-text-subtitle">Cookies</span><br><br>We also use “cookies” to collect information, provide and improve our Services to you. A cookie is a small file that we transfer to your Device. We may use “persistent cookies” to save your registration ID and login password for future logins to the Service. <br><br>We may use “session ID cookies” to enable certain features of the Service, to better understand how you interact with the Service, to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on the Service, and to enable third-party vendors, including Google, to serve ads based on someone&#x27;s past visits to our website. This also enables third-party vendors, including Google, to show our ads on sites across the internet. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all aspects of the Service. <br><br>Our affiliates use cookies to make it easier for us to gather analytics about product usage and to help us provide interactive support for our users. The use of cookies by our affiliates is not covered by our privacy policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies.</p>
          <p class="privacy-page-text"><span class="privacy-text-subtitle">Information about your users</span><br><br>As part of our Services you may install our products on your domains. In this case we also use “cookies” and other means to collect information about your users, but only to the extent necessary for us to provide our services to you. This information typically includes, but is not limited to, your users&#x27; location (based on their device IP address), device language preferences and previous activity with our Service.<br><br>We never deliberately collect personally identifiable information about your users. All data is aggregated and impersonalized, and is discarded immediately after processing.</p>

          <p class="privacy-page-text"><span class="privacy-text-subtitle">Analytics</span><br><br>We also collect some information (ourselves or using third party services) that requires using logging and cookies, such as IP address, which can sometimes be correlated with Personal Information. <br><br>We use this information for the above purposes and to monitor and analyze use of the Service, for the Service&#x27;s technical administration, to increase our Service&#x27;s functionality and user-friendliness, to verify users have the authorization needed for the Service to process their requests, and for advertising purposes. <br><br>As of the date this policy went into effect, we use Google Analytics.

If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you Services, you may delete your account. <br><br>We may retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements and rights, or if it is not technically reasonably feasible to remove it. <br><br>Consistent with these requirements, we will try to delete your information quickly upon request. Please note, however, that there might be latency in deleting information from our servers and backed-up versions might exist after deletion. In addition, we do not delete information from our servers files if you have that information in common with other users.</p>

          <p class="privacy-page-text"><span class="privacy-text-subtitle">Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement Agencies Requests</span><br><br>We may disclose to third parties data stored in your account and information about you that we collect when we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with a law, regulation, or compulsory legal request, such as to comply with a subpoena; (b) protect the safety of any person from death or serious bodily injury; (c) prevent fraud or abuse of Signalayer or its users; or (d) to protect Signalayer&#x27;s rights. <br><br>If we provide any data stored in your account to a law enforcement agency, we will remove Signalayer&#x27;s encryption from the information before providing it to law enforcement.</p>
          <p class="privacy-page-text"><span class="privacy-text-subtitle">Business Transfers</span><br><br>If Signalayer is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction, but we will notify you (for example, via email, sign in notification, and/or a prominent notice on our website) if that happens or if your information otherwise becomes subject to a different privacy policy in lieu of this one. We will also notify you of choices you may have regarding the information.</p>
